I have always thought about sharing what I learned. At least I benefited from other developers blogs. Writing
has never been my strong point. Its never to late to start.

In the last few months, I have exclusively working on AWS IoT and Electronjs. The tremendous amount lessons were
learned from this journey. But I worry, things learnt today, might be forgotten in the future. Yes, the solution is
committed in code. But what matter is the `journey` taken to arrive at the solution. Therefore, I have decided to
write this blog to share my journey.

As Arthur Ashe said:

> Success is a journey, not a destination. The doing is often more important than the outcome.

I found this quote is suite well for software engineers. Like working out math equations, the steps
are more important than the solution. Software engineering is to break down large problems into smaller steps. These steps
forms the the solution to the problems. You also can say these step are the journey to the solution. In the end, what
matters is the journey.

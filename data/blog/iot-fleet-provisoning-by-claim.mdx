## First of many
In the last few months, I have exclusively working on AWS IoT and Electronjs. The tremendous amount lessons were
learned from this journey. But I worry, things learnt today, might be forgotten in the future. Yes, the solution is
committed in code. But what matter is the `journey` taken to arrive at the solution. Therefore, I have decided to
write this blog to share my journey.

Another reason to share this journey is I cannot share the *solution*. What I wrote is not open source.

This post will go through the steps of provisioning an AWS IoT device using the [aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2).

## AWS IoT Thing Registration
Okay, let's talk about AWS IoT. When it comes to IoT, the first thing to understand is how to provision a device.
Provision a device refers to registering a device to AWS IoT. Only registered devices can communicate with AWS IoT Core.
Security is a big concern in IoT. To prevent intrusion, it is essential that the provisioning process is secure.

AWS provides three ways of registering a device to be an IoT Thing:

1. X.509 client certificate. This is the recommended way.
1. ~~AWS Signature Version 4~~. For example using `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key`.
1. ~~Amazon cognito identities~~. This is for web applications.

In order for the device and AWS IoT Core to talk to each other, both needs to have same certificate. An IoT device
should have an unique certificate registered in AWS IoT Core. This X.509 certificate is the unique identifier for the device.
Security enforced by the policy is attached to this certificate.

The tricky part is to register the X.509 certificate in AWS IoT Core and install the same certificate on the device.
The process to achieve this is called [device provisioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-provision.html).
To cater various use cases, AWS provides few ways provisioning X.509 certificates. Here are some of them.

1. ~~Manually via the AWS console.~~
1. ~~Just-in-time provisioning (JITP) or just-in-time registration (JITR).~~
1. ~~Provisioning by trusted user.~~ *This requires to an end user/install to register the device and install the unique device certificates.*
1. [Provisioning by claim](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/provision-wo-cert.html).
This is one way of fleet provisioning. A good fit for my use case.

## AWS IoT Infrastructure

Before using `aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2`, the correct AWS IoT infrastructure needs to be configured. I will use `awscli` to configure
infrastructure.

This is the infrastructure required for provisioning by claim.

* Claim certificate
  * This is a certificate with privileges restricted only to issuing client certificate. It can be considered a
  `birthing` certificate. This certificate is saved in the electron app source code.
* Fleet provisioning template. This is a template defines how a new IoT Thing is registered. This includes the following:
  * Once the *birthing* certificate is validated, a new client certificate with `full citizen` policy is issued.
  ```json
  # fleet-provisioning-template.json
  "policy": {
    "Properties": {
        "PolicyName": "full-citizen-policy"
    },
    "Type": "AWS::IoT::Policy"
  },
  ```
  * What to name the IoT Thing. The `DeviceId` parameter will be used as the `ThingName`
  ```json
  # fleet-provisioning-template.json
  "Properties": {
    "ThingGroups": [],
        "ThingName": {
        "Ref": "DeviceId"
    }
  },
  ```

A bash script to create this infrastructure is here. Remember to update `AWS_ACCOUNT` and `AWS_REGION`.

```bash:infra/infra-up.sh showLineNumbers
#!/usr/bin/env bash

APP=electron-iot-app
AWS_ACCOUNT=
AWS_REGION=
FLEET_PROVISIONING_TEMPLATE=fleet-provisioning-template
FLEET_PROVISIONING_ROLE=role-fleet-provisioning-template

# Mac OS only syntax
sed -i '.bak' "s/AWS_ACCOUNT/$AWS_ACCOUNT/g" birth-policy.json full-citizen-policy.json
sed -i '.bak' "s/AWS_REGION/$AWS_REGION/g" birth-policy.json full-citizen-policy.json
sed -i '.bak' "s/FLEET_PROVISIONING_TEMPLATE/$FLEET_PROVISIONING_TEMPLATE/g" birth-policy.json full-citizen-policy.json

aws iot create-policy \
  --policy-name full-citizen-policy \
  --policy-document file://full-citizen-policy.json | jq

aws iot create-policy \
  --policy-name birth-policy \
  --policy-document file://birth-policy.json | jq

aws iam create-role \
  --role-name $FLEET_PROVISIONING_ROLE \
  --assume-role-policy-document \
  '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Action":"sts:AssumeRole","Effect":"Allow","Principal":{"Service":"iot.amazonaws.com"}}]}' | jq

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name $FLEET_PROVISIONING_ROLE \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSIoTThingsRegistration | jq

# wait for the role to be created
sleep 10

aws iot create-provisioning-template \
  --template-name $FLEET_PROVISIONING_TEMPLATE \
  --provisioning-role-arn arn:aws:iam::"$AWS_ACCOUNT":role/"$FLEET_PROVISIONING_ROLE" \
  --template-body file://fleet-provisioning-template.json \
  --enabled | jq

CERTIFICATE_ARN=$(aws iot create-keys-and-certificate --set-as-active \
  --certificate-pem-outfile "claim.cert.pem" \
  --public-key-outfile "claim.public.key" \
  --private-key-outfile "claim.private.key" | jq '.certificateArn')

aws iot attach-policy --policy-name birth-policy --target "$CERTIFICATE_ARN"

curl -O https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem
```

## Let's try the fleet provisioning sample code.

Running [fleet provisioning](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2/tree/main/samples) sample code gave
me lots errors. The package dependencies are outdated. I cloned the [aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js-v2)
repo and made it work.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhex900/electron-iot-app
cd electron-iot-app/fleet_provisioning
npm install
npm run tsc
```

Now we are ready to run the sample code. You can run the commands below. Remember for this work, the infrastructure
script must be run first.

```bash
ENDPOINT=$(aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS | jq -r '.endpointAddress')

node dist/index.js \
        --endpoint "$ENDPOINT" \
        --ca_file ../infra/AmazonRootCA1.pem \
        --cert ../infra/claim.cert.pem \
        --key ../infra/claim.private.key \
        --template_name fleet-provisioning-template \
        --template_parameters "{\"DeviceId\":\"611908202515\"}"
        ```

If things works well, this should be the output.
```bash
Subscribing to CreateKeysAndCertificate Accepted and Rejected topics..
Publishing to CreateKeysAndCertificate topic..
CreateKeysAndCertificateResponse for certificateId=c12823c8...
Subscribing to RegisterThing Accepted and Rejected topics..
Publishing to RegisterThing topic..
token=hzMkg2TTJlblkyTW4yVW...
RegisterThingResponse for thingName=611908202515
```

Congratulations! You have successfully registered an IoT Thing with a X.509 certificate.

Let check what actually happened.

Go to AWS console -> IoT Core -> Manage -> Things

![fleet-provisioning](/static/images/fleet-provisioning.png)

If you run the fleet provisioning code again, you will see a new certificate is created for the IoT Thing. This is not
a desired behavior. IoT Thing should only have one certificate. In the future, I will talk about how to implement keep
one certificate per IoT Thing.

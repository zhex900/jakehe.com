Recently I encountered a frustrating problemðŸ˜¤. For some reason, I cannot map a *many-to-one* relationship between
 two [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org) entities.

Doctrine gave this *meaningful* error.

> Missing value for primary key id on Entity/Post

Let's look at the database schema

<div align="center">
    <Image alt="doctrine-query-with-no-entity-relationship-db1"
    src="/static/images/doctrine-query-with-no-entity-relationship-db1.png" width={640} height={560} />
</div>

All `sign`, `dictionary` and `locations` tables have `id` as the primary key. `map_feature` has `feature_id` as the primary key.
My goal is list all signs with corresponding `display_text`.

```php
// this works
sign->getMapFeature()->getLocation()->getDictionary()->getDisplayText()
```

This is also a valid relationship. Theoretically I can bypass `map_feature` and directly join `sign` and `locations` tables.

<div align="center">
    <Image alt="doctrine-query-with-no-entity-relationship-db2"
    src="/static/images/doctrine-query-with-no-entity-relationship-db2.png" width={800} height={178} />
</div>

This is a valid SQL expression. It return the correct result.

```SQL
SELECT sign.sign_id, dictionary.display_text FROM sign
JOIN location ON sign.sign_id = location.feature_id
JOIN dictionary ON dictionary.id = location.dictionary_id
```

Since the relationship between `location` and `dictionary` are already mapped. I thought just need to add the mapping between
 `sign` and `location`.

```PHP
// Entity/Sign.php
/**
 * Many signs have one location. This is the owning side.
 *
 * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="Location")
 * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="sign_id", nullable=true, referencedColumnName="feature_id")
 */
private ?Location $location = null;
```

To access the `display_text` from `sign`, I just need to use `sign->getLocation()->getDisplayText()`.
But this is where I hit a wall.

> Missing value for primary key id on Entity/Location

What does this mean? All the `id` in `location` table are populated. Luckily, I found a similar problem on
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40437444/join-columns-by-referencedcolumnname-that-is-not-primary-key-id).

This post pointed out a [limitation in doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/2.9/reference/limitations-and-known-issues.html#join-columns-with-non-primary-keys).

Here is the light bulb momentðŸ’¡. The reason for the mapping error is `location.feature_id` is not a primary key.

What should I now?

If there is an entity relationship mapping I could write this query in the entity repository.

```PHP
public function findSignsWithDisplayText()
{
    return $this->createQueryBuilder('sign')
        ->select([
            'sign.signId',
            'd.displayText',
        ])
        ->join('sign.location', 'l') // this won't work
        ->join('l.dictionary', 'd')
        ->groupBy('sign.signId')
        ->getQuery()
        ->getResult();
}
```

I cannot use this since there is no association between `sign` and `location`. I thought about using Doctrine's
[Native SQL](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/2.9/reference/native-sql.html). But this
[post](http://www.inanzzz.com/index.php/post/4ern/writing-doctrine-query-builder-without-relations-between-entities)
gave me enough help to solve it.

In the end, the solution is simple.

Remember I want to bypass `map_feature` table (`mapFeature` entity). I cannot use the existing association between `sign`
and `mapFeature`.

```PHP
/**
 * Many signs have one mapFeature. This is the owning side.
 *
 * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="mapFeature")
 * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="sign_id", nullable=true, referencedColumnName="feature_id")
 */
private ?mapFeature $mapFeature = null;
```

In order to directly reference `signId` in the `sign` entity. I need to add a new `signId` property.

```PHP
// Entity/Sign.php
/**
 * @var ?string
 *
 * This is required by doctrine query builder
 *
 * @ORM\Column(name="sign_id", type="string", nullable=true)
 */
private ?string $signId = null;
```

This is query to the list of signs with corresponding `display_text`

```PHP
public function findSignsWithDisplayText()
{
    return $this->createQueryBuilder('sign')
        ->select([
            'sign.signId',
            'd.displayText',
        ])
        // join with no association
        ->join('AppBundle:Location', 'l', 'WITH', 'l.feature = sign.signId')
        ->join('l.dictionary', 'd')
        ->groupBy('sign.signId')
        ->getQuery()
        ->getResult();
}
```

If you use [mapping entities outside of a bundle](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/doctrine.html#custom-mapping-entities-in-a-bundle)
Remember to replace `AppBundle` to the correct namespace.

The bonus is all the existing tests still passed.

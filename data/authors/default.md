I'm a software engineer at [pam.co](https://pam.co). We proudly build wayfinding solutions in Sydney, Australia🇦🇺. 

In 2000, I was introduced to programming at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/computer-science-and-engineering). My first line of code was in *Haskell*. 

```haskell {1,3-4} showLineNumbers
-- print even numbers from 1 to 10
-- [2,4,6,8,10]
[ x | x <- [1..10], x `mod` 2 == 0]
```
Strange looking creature🥶 right? I was told, this is called functional programming. It is declarative not procedural. In the computer lab (back then not many people had laptops) it took me a while to get my head around it. Once, it *clicked*💡everything made sense. Unfortunately, many of my peers gave up and decided programming was not for them. 

In 2004, I graduated with Honours in Computer Science. Even after so many years, I am still very fond of many geeky subjects like formal logic, advance algorithms and compilers 

During university, I became a Christian through a classmate. Knowing the Lord Jesus changed my life. After working for two years, I followed the Lord to the Full-time Training in Hamilton New Zealand (FTTH). FTTH is a two year graduate program that cultivates young people to learn Biblical truth and live a life that fulfils God’s eternal purpose.

Upon graduation in December 2007, I accepted God’s call to serve Him full-time. The following year, I moved to the Perth to work as a youth minister.

After 10 years of Christian ministry I moved back to software development.

The tech stack I work with involves, Electron, React, PHP Symfony, Doctrine.

While in FTTH, I meet my wonderful wife. We live in Sydney with our three kids👧👦👦 + one Doberman🐕 and 5 chickens🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓.
